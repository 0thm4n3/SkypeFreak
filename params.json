A full open source forensic framework for Skype. I love to analyze applications and explore how things work behind the scenes. The main goal of this application is to aid in forensic investigations. \r\n\r\n## Is this only for Windows?\r\nNo. I am coding a cross platform version for Windows, Linux and OS X. Currently only the Windows version is being released in Python. This application will be available to you in Ruby and PHP soon. \r\n\r\n## What is so special in this?\r\nActually there are many other tools which could the same thing, but I thought writing a open source tool to help people understand what is really going on and anyone can customize this according their needs. \r\n\r\n## Will there be a big Forensic framework?\r\nYes me, Hood3dRob1n and Nick Knight are planning a full fledged forensic framework including most famous applications such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc. This will be available in Python, Ruby and PHP. \r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nNone of the application you use today are safe. They often log what all you do. Do not use this application with out any kind of permissions because it would result in violation of privacy. The author takes no responsibility of any kind of damage you cause. Please use this for educational purposes only. \r\n\r\nFeedback is warmly welcome. \r\nFollow me https://twitter.com/OsandaMalith","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
